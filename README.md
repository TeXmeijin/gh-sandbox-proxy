# gh-sandbox-proxy

[日本語](README.ja.md) | English

`gh-sandbox-proxy` is a drop-in-ish `gh` wrapper that runs the official GitHub
CLI inside a disposable Docker container.

It is primarily for developers who let coding agents such as Claude Code,
Codex, or similar tools run local shell commands. The aim is to keep day-to-day
`gh` workflows usable while making host-side GitHub CLI token harvesting less
straightforward for automated or opportunistic processes.

## Why

Recent package supply-chain incidents have made a practical risk more visible:
developer machines, especially agent-assisted ones, often keep GitHub CLI
authentication in predictable local locations, and a single command can expose a
usable token to a process running on that machine.

This project does not claim to solve endpoint compromise. Its goal is narrower:
reduce the value of the host OS as a place to harvest GitHub CLI credentials,
while preserving the day-to-day ergonomics of `gh` as much as possible. It is a
friction layer, not a guarantee.

The design target is practical:

- keep GitHub CLI auth state out of the host OS
- make `gh auth token` return nothing useful on the host
- keep most `gh` command interfaces unchanged
- expire the authenticated environment after a short TTL, default `1h`

The Docker image pins GitHub CLI release asset SHA256 checksums for supported
Linux architectures.

It is not a perfect defense against arbitrary local code execution. While the
sandbox container is alive, anything that can run commands in that container can
use the container-local GitHub CLI session.

## Install

For most users:

```zsh
./install.sh
```

Add the printed PATH line to your shell config if `~/.local/bin` is not already
on PATH:

```zsh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Open a new shell, then verify:

```zsh
which gh
gh --help
gh auth token
```

`which gh` should point at the installed wrapper symlink. `gh auth token` should
be blocked by the wrapper.

For Claude Code or other agents that do not reliably read shell startup files,
install the non-interactive zsh PATH shim:

```zsh
./install.sh --zshenv
```

This adds a small marked block to `~/.zshenv` so `zsh -lc 'gh ...'` resolves the
wrapper before Homebrew paths. The installer also runs command-resolution checks
and warns if `zsh -lc` still resolves a different `gh`.

If PATH shims are not enough, install a system-level symlink:

```zsh
./install.sh --system-link
```

This backs up the existing `/usr/local/bin/gh` once and replaces it with a
symlink to this wrapper. The official Homebrew `gh` remains available at paths
such as `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`.

To uninstall:

```zsh
./uninstall.sh
```

## Agent Setup

This repository also includes a Claude Code Skill at:

```text
skills/gh-sandbox-proxy-installer/SKILL.md
```

Use it when asking an agent to install, verify, troubleshoot PATH issues, or
uninstall the wrapper on another machine. The Skill delegates the actual machine
changes to `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`, so human and agent installs follow the
same deterministic path. This is the recommended setup route when installing
for Claude Code or Codex users because the agent can inspect local repository
roots and propose `workspace_mounts`.

## Usage

Use `gh` normally:

```zsh
gh issue view 123
gh pr list
gh pr create -B develop -d
gh workflow run "Deploy" --ref "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

Commands that open a browser, such as `gh pr list -w`, are also proxied. The
Linux `gh` process writes the target URL to a container-local hook, then the
wrapper opens that URL on the macOS host.

For tests, override the host opener:

```zsh
GH_SANDBOX_OPEN=/bin/echo gh pr list -w
```

The first authenticated command starts a container and runs:

```zsh
gh auth login -h github.com --web
```

inside the container. Follow the printed browser/device flow. The token is stored
inside a tmpfs mount attached to the sandbox, not in the host GitHub CLI config
or a Docker volume. The tmpfs disappears when the sandbox container exits.

## Sandbox Controls

```zsh
gh sandbox status
gh sandbox cleanup
gh sandbox build
gh sandbox config
gh sandbox suggest-mounts
```

`cleanup` removes the current container immediately.

## Config

Default config path:

```text
~/.config/gh-sandbox-proxy/config.yml
```

Override:

```zsh
export GH_SANDBOX_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yml
```

Important fields:

```yaml
image: gh-sandbox-proxy:latest
ttl: 1h
active_window_enabled: false
active_window_timezone: Asia/Tokyo
active_window_start: "10:00"
active_window_end: "19:00"
auth_storage: tmpfs
auth_tmpfs_size: 16m
workspace_mounts:
  - ~/ghq
  - ~/Documents/src
container_name: gh-sandbox-proxy
auto_auth: true
auth_hostname: github.com
blocked:
  - ["auth", "token"]
  - ["auth", "status", "--show-token"]
```

The YAML parser is intentionally tiny. Keep the config in the same simple shape
as `config.example.yml`.

`workspace_mounts` should contain stable ancestor directories that hold your git
repositories. The wrapper mounts these roots once and maps the host current
directory to the matching container path when running `gh`. This lets
repo-aware commands read `.git`, remotes, and the current branch without
recreating the sandbox each time you `cd` between repositories.

If your current directory is not under any configured workspace mount, commands
that depend on local git context may fail. Use `--repo OWNER/REPO` for those
commands, or add an appropriate ancestor directory to `workspace_mounts`.

To keep a sandbox for a normal workday in Japan while retaining `ttl` as the
fallback outside that window:

```yaml
ttl: 1h
active_window_enabled: true
active_window_timezone: Asia/Tokyo
active_window_start: "10:00"
active_window_end: "19:00"
```

This is enforced by the wrapper and the container lifecycle, not by a Docker
volume TTL feature. When the sandbox starts, the wrapper calculates the lifetime
and starts the container with `--rm`, a tmpfs auth directory, and `sleep
<seconds>` as the main process. When sleep exits, Docker removes the container
and the tmpfs auth data disappears.

## Security Model

This wrapper protects against accidentally or casually exposing a long-lived host
GitHub CLI token:

- host `gh auth token` is blocked
- host `gh auth status --show-token` is blocked
- official `gh` auth files are stored only in the sandbox tmpfs
- the container exits after the configured expiry policy
  (`ttl` by default, or the active window when enabled)
- `gh sandbox cleanup` removes the authenticated container immediately

This wrapper does not protect against every local threat:

- Docker administrators can inspect or exec into containers
- commands run inside the container can use the active GitHub session
- GitHub-issued OAuth tokens are not revoked automatically when a container is
  deleted
- mounted workspace directories can be read and written by commands running
  inside the container
